## What is a AWS profile ?

In the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment, a profile is a **named set of credentials and other configuration details** that can be used to access AWS services.

Profiles are typically stored in a local file on the userâ€™s computer. They can be used to specify the credentials, region, and other settings that the AWS command-line tools or SDKs should use when interacting with AWS.

To create or manage profiles, you can use the `aws configure` command, which will prompt you for the necessary details and store the profile in a file called `.aws/credentials` in your home directory.

You can then specify which profile to use when running AWS commands by using the `--profile` option, or by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.

## How can it make my life easier ?

There are several reasons why using AWS profiles can be useful in the AWS environment:

- Profiles allow you to **store and use multiple sets of credentials** for different purposes, such as for different AWS accounts or for different environments (e.g. development, staging, and production). This can make it easier to **switch between different credentials** without having to manually enter them each time.
- Profiles allow you to **store and use sensitive credentials in a secure manner**, as the credentials are stored in encrypted form in a local file on your computer. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to your AWS resources

## Conclusion

Overall, using AWS profiles can provide **convenience, security, and flexibility** when working with AWS services. It is a **best practice** to use profiles whenever possible, especially if you are working with **multiple AWS accounts or environments**.
